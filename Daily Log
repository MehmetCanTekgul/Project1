Day1: Today I will be defining Project Scope and user personas. 
As I have some personal problems I have couple of days break from project yet I turn back and I will have double time per day to cover time I lose today I created 4 different personas with different needs 
Day3: I started to create wireframes by using figma yet I decided I am not experienced person in such applications so I decided to download and use some similar applications and even Pinterest so I can better understand what people want to see as a application.
Day4: I created Menu and Welcome section that will say Good Morning etc when user open the application and still try to figure out what people like to see when using alike applications.
